# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The Garden

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A visual story about a garden mystery.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will use RenPy to make my project. I am probably going to using a combination of sprites and background from Creative Commons. I want to give the characters dialogue and choices to the users.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I think a good outcome is just the general shell of the story with all the art.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be the good outcome with a script.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be the great outcome with a minigame in it.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

- Figure out how to use renpy
- learn how to draw sprites and draw them
- make a storyline + script
- find a background
- program the story
- figure out what minigame is would do
- make minigame
